<p>The <strong>224.100 MHz</strong> (input: -1.6 MHz @ 222.5 MHz) repeater is located downtown
at the University of Texas at Austin campus. Hosted by KA5D and KB5PRZ, it is
usually linked to the <a href="https://ka5d.com/repeaters/">KA5D system</a> via
AllStarLink.</p>
<p>This repeater consists of two Motorola CDM1550LS+ radios converted from 220 MHz
to the 222 MHz US amateur band.</p>
<p>It puts out about 30W into a Hustler G7-220 antenna atop the Physics, Math, and
Astronomy building on the UT campus. Receive coverage is assisted by a
<a href="https://www.downeastmicrowave.com/product-p/l222lna.htm">L222LNA</a> low noise
amplifier (LNA) from Down East Microwave.</p>
<p>The repeater is controlled by a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspberry Pi OS and uses
AllStarLink as its controller.</p>
<p>Special thanks to KA5D and KB5PRZ for hosting, KI5PZN and K5JM for helping with
sourcing parts and helping with installation, and W5NDS for supplying the
Hustler antenna.</p>

<p><strong>Saturdays, 21:00 local time</strong></p>
<p>Hosted by &quot;The Good Guys&quot; 222 MHz group in Chicago, the 224.1 machine links into
this net via AllStarLink every Saturday night, just before 21:00 local time. The
format of the net consists of a few social questions asked by the net controller
along with a general chance for people to share what they have been working on.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://therainreport.com/">RAIN Report</a> can often be heard during the net
as well.</p>
<p>This is a fun net, open to all amateurs, and we're glad to be able to bring it
to the Austin area.</p>

Austin Amateur Radio Club (N5XU). It is a directed, social net open to all
amateurs with a slight focus on the happenings of the N5XU club.</p>
<p>It takes place Wednesday nights at 20:00 local on this repeater and on the rest

<h3 id="rolli-thursday-night-oak-hill-amateur-radio-club-net">ðŸ‘€ <a href="https://n5oak.org/nets">Thursday Night Oak Hill Amateur Radio Club Net</a></h3>
<p><strong>Thursdays, 20:00 local time</strong></p>
<p>This net, brought to you by the Oak Hill Amateur Radio Club right here in
Austin, is a long-running, directed, social net that takes place weekly on
Thursdays at 20:00 local time.</p>
<p>The net opens with taking short-time check-ins, briefly tests your knowledge of
the general or extra class question pool with a question or two asked to the
net, and then moves on to a &quot;news and nuggets&quot; section. In this section, a brief
article, usually relating to ham radio, is read out over the air for
discussion. After this, club news and updates are given. Finally, the net moves
on to the social portion of the net, taking check-ins from all over the world
(via AllStarLink and Echolink). Each person has a chance to tell people what
they've been up to, and then the floor is opened up for comments and replies.</p>
<p>This is a fun, informative net and is a great way to find people with similar
radio interests to collaborate with. Check it out.</p>
