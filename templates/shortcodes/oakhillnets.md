### ðŸ‘€ [Thursday Night Oak Hill Amateur Radio Club Net](https://n5oak.org/nets)

**Thursdays, 20:00 local time**

This net, brought to you by the Oak Hill Amateur Radio Club right here in
Austin, is a long-running, directed, social net that takes place weekly on
Thursdays at 20:00 local time.

The net opens with taking short-time check-ins, briefly tests your knowledge of
the general or extra class question pool with a question or two asked to the
net, and then moves on to a "news and nuggets" section. In this section, a brief
article, usually relating to ham radio, is read out over the air for
discussion. After this, club news and updates are given. Finally, the net moves
on to the social portion of the net, taking check-ins from all over the world
(via AllStarLink and Echolink). Each person has a chance to tell people what
they've been up to, and then the floor is opened up for comments and replies.

This is a fun, informative net and is a great way to find people with similar
radio interests to collaborate with. Check it out.

This net, also brought to you by the Oak Hill Amateur Radio Club is run by

repeater (and links), and social jesting is also encouraged.
