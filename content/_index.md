# Welcome

This site documents the AI5A ham radio system in Austin, TX (EM10) along with
my general adventures in the amateur radio hobby.

The <em>AI5A ham radio system</em> currently consists of the following for
public use:

* [Repeater 224.100- 100.0 Hz](@/infrastructure/224.md) (hosted by KA5D, UT Austin)

And, of course, [the shack](@/shack/index.md) for personal use.
