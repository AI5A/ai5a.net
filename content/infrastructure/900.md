# Introduction

The **927.9750 MHz** (simplex) AllStarLink node is a public-access node meaning
that users are free to connect to it and from it as they desire (being mindful
of other users, of course).

The system runs on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ board with a Kenwood TK-941, and into a
KP-20 antenna at the AI5A home QTH.

The system has decent coverage extending to the north. It carries several local
nets as well as often linking into the K5TRA 927-Tech network.
