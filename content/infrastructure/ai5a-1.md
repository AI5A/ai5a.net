# Introduction

The **AI5A-1** APRS digipeater provides a fill-in for the South Central Austin
area.

It uses direwolf and an ARA-1 interface board by TechnoByGeorge to interface
with an Icom IC-229H. It runs at about 10W out and shares an antenna with the
[441.350 MHz](@/infrastructure/441.md) repeater via a diplexer.

It should pass messages to local users and otherwise serves as a digipeater +
igate for the area.
